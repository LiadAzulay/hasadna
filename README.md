# Hasadna monorepo

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/hasadna/hasadna.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/hasadna/hasadna)

We're doing an experiment to see what it would be like to work in a monorepo in Hasadna.

For more details on the monorepo approach, see [trunkbaseddevelopment.com/monorepos](http://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/monorepos).

Some monorepo etiquette:
1. Don't store large files in the repo (>500kb), or many small files. Until we figure out a way to deal with them, you can store them in a different repo.
2. If you use code belonging to another project, talk to the people of that project about it. If you don't, they might accidentally break your code.
3. If you change code common to multiple projects, do it thoughfully.
4. Kindly provide a LICENSE file for your project.

Happy coding!
